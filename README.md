## Pano Logic G2 Reverse Engineering

I have been working on reverse engineering the Pano Logic G2 on and off for some time now. This project is intended as a repository of some of the random information I have collected or created in that time.

[Introduction](pages/intro.md) - overview of the Pano Logic G2 device, and very brief project background

[Physical Description](pages/physical.md) - some hi-res photos of one of my G2's

[Bill of Materials](pages/bom.md) - complete list of all the parts of a G2, including full device names of the SMD parts

[Reverse Engineering](pages/reverse_engineering.md) - brief overview of the process I used to reverse engineer, and photos of bare boards.

[Breakout Board](pages/bob.md) - details and photos of the breakout board

[BOB USB Software](pages/bobusb.md) - tba

[Useful References](pages/references.md) - sources of information useful to a Pano hacker
